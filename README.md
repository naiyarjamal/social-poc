## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd social-poc

# Install dependencies
yarn install
```

### 2. Set up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Create .env file
touch .env
```

Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:

```env
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 3. Start Development Server

```bash
# Start the development server
yarn dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### 4. Build for Production

```bash
# Build the project
yarn build

# Preview the production build
yarn preview
```

## üîë How to Set up the OpenAI API Key

### Step 1: Get an OpenAI API Key

1. Visit [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Navigate to the API section
4. Go to "API Keys" in your dashboard
5. Click "Create new secret key"
6. Copy the generated API key

### Step 2: Configure the API Key

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root (if not already created)
2. Add your API key:
   ```env
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
   ```
3. Restart the development server after adding the API key

### Step 3: Verify Setup

- The "Help Me Write" buttons should work without authentication errors
- Check the browser console for any API-related errors
- Test the AI writing assistance on Step 3 of the form

### Data Flow

1. **Form State Management**:

   - React Hook Form handles form validation and state
   - Form data is automatically saved to localStorage on each step
   - Data persists across browser sessions

2. **Step Navigation**:

   - Controlled by `step` state in App.tsx
   - Form validation prevents progression to next step
   - Previous steps remain accessible

3. **AI Writing Assistance**:

   - Triggered by "Help Me Write" buttons in Step 3
   - Sends field context to OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo
   - Returns suggestions in a modal popup
   - Users can accept, edit, or discard suggestions

4. **Internationalization**:
   - i18next handles language switching
   - RTL layout support for Arabic
   - All text content is translatable

### Key Features Implementation
